# Assignment 4 - Forked from Assignment 2

### Domain
---

The domain of this webpage and assignment are the members of Team Rochester who are all students at U of R.


### Ontology Triples
---
The Homepage is defined by a summary of the city as well as a list of the students in the city.

Each student is defined by the Taxonomy terms below.
* Each student has a class year
* Each student has a major
* Each student has a hometown
* Each student has either work experience or class experience
* Each student has interests outside of classes


### Taxonomy
---
* Class Year
* Major
* Hometown
* Work Experience / Class Work
* Hobbies and Interests


### Choreography Explanation
---
Topics or sections within the student pages will all be in the same order and have the same name. This is to make sure it is easy to read, easy to follow, and easy to switch and compare between students without getting lost.

There will be four pages, where the homepage is the index. Each page including the index will have a navagation bar to access any other page.
1. Homepage
2. Student 1
3. Student 2
4. Student 3

In each Student Page, there will be three sections:
1. About Me
2. Major
3. Work Experience / Coursework

The first section will include information on Hometown and Hobbies and Interests if availible.
The second will include Major and Class Year.
The third will include any Work Experience / Coursework. 


### Changes Made
---
1. Some students are missing data for taxonomy so that is filled out
2. Home Page has little information and does not use space efficiently
3. Include list of students on homepage
4. The section header titles for each student page are not consistent
5. Font should also be increased
