		The other computer science courses that I’ve taken are: 170 and 131. I plan to minor in computer science. I’ve also taken audio music engineering courses like 191 and 193. I’m really interested in sound design and creating music. I’ve worked in the music studio a lot with my uncle so that’s where I learned how to mix music.
