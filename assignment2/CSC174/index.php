	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
		I’m from Brooklyn, NY. My family is from Trinidad. I grew up in Manhattan and went to school there. I’m a junior Digital Media Studies major. I went to an elementary school called ps41 and then the same place for middle and high school called NYC Lab High School. In 10th grade, I spent a year in Miami Florida. I only spent a year there, but I had a lot of fun. My hobby in high school was running track. Now I’m in cheer club twice a week.
