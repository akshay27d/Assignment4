	<h1>Major</h1>
	<p>
		I ended up changing my major from International Relations last semester. I’m happy I made the change because I do feel like it fits me better. I’ve have worked on campus before. Before I worked at Starbucks and off campus at the Laser Lab. I took a lot of classes this semester, so my schedule is too full for work.
