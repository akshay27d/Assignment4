	<h1>Interests</h1>
	<p>
		I’m also really interested in photography. I enjoy taking pictures. Along with this class I’m also taking Digital Media Studies 103 where we’re learning more about photography and how to edit photos in Photoshop. We recently had to take photos and work on choosing a theme to move forward.
